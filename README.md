Sure, here's a nice README.md document for your Proof of Concept (PoC) Git repository where you're applying the concepts of Micro Front-ends in Angular using Module Federation inside a monorepo workspace:

# Angular Micro Front-ends PoC

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for implementing Micro Front-ends (MFEs) in an Angular application using Module Federation within a monorepo workspace. It demonstrates how to create a shell application and a remote application, as well as a shared library for components and services.

## Overview

The monorepo workspace consists of the following projects:

1. **shell-app**: The main application that serves as the container for the Micro Front-ends. This app is responsible for orchestrating the integration of different MFEs.

2. **mfe-app**: A remote application that can be integrated into the `shell-app` as a Micro Front-end. This app is built separately and can be deployed independently.

3. **shared-lib**: A shared library that contains common components and services that can be used across the `shell-app` and `mfe-app`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this PoC, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/angular-mfe-poc.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd angular-mfe-poc
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the shared library:

   ```bash
   npm run build:shared-lib
   ```

4. Start the development server for the `shell-app`:

   ```bash
   npm run start:shell-app
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, start the development server for the `mfe-app`:

   ```bash
   npm run start:mfe-app
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the `shell-app` running with the integrated `mfe-app`.

## Module Federation

This PoC leverages the Module Federation feature of Webpack 5 to enable the integration of Micro Front-ends. The `shell-app` acts as the host application, while the `mfe-app` is exposed as a remote application.

The configuration for Module Federation is defined in the respective project's `webpack.config.js` files. The `shell-app` imports the `mfe-app` as a remote module, allowing it to render the components and use the services provided by the `mfe-app`.

## Shared Library

The `shared-lib` project contains common components and services that can be used across the `shell-app` and `mfe-app`. This helps in maintaining consistency and reducing code duplication across different applications in the monorepo.

To use a component or service from the `shared-lib` in either the `shell-app` or `mfe-app`, simply import it into the respective project and use it as needed.

## Deployment

While this PoC focuses on the development workflow, you can deploy the `shell-app` and `mfe-app` separately in a production environment. The `shared-lib` can be published to a private npm registry and consumed by both applications.
